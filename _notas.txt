This's been done based on a course from Eric Roby at his youtube channel:
How to build a NextJS + FastAPI application (step-by-step tutorial) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g566eI2EmeY


To run the fastapi app:
fastapi run main.py         # With the new[standard] version - fastapi[standard]==0.112.0
uvicorn main:app --reload   # It used to be done this way
